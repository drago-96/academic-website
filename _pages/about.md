Hi, I'm Riccardo, and I am currently pusuing a PhD in cryptography at CISPA, supervised by [Nico Döttling](https://sites.google.com/site/nicodoettling/).

My research topics are very broad; given my formation as a mathematician I am interested on isogenies and abstract constructions, but my passion is cryptanalysis and in general breaking stuff!

I am also really passionate about doing sports, and in general anything related to mountains :D

#### My background

I hold a Bachelor (2018) and a Master (2021) degree in Mathematics, obtained at [Università di Pisa](https://www.unipi.it/en/) and [Scuola Normale Superiore](https://www.sns.it/en). During my Master's thesis I worked with Emmanuela on isogeny-based Oblivious Transfer protocols. Going back to my high school days, I have two gold medals at the national mathematical olympiads, and a [participation](https://www.imo-official.org/participant_r.aspx?id=26099) at the IMO.

I also play CTFs with pwnthem0le and about:blankets whenever I have a free weekend. My team from Univesity of Pisa won the 2020 edition of [CyberChallengeIT](https://cyberchallenge.it/), and with Team Italy we got 3rd place at [ECSC](https://ecsc.eu) in Prague in 2021. I also help organize the CTF competition and conference [m0leCon](https://m0lecon.it/) that we host in our beautiful Torino!
